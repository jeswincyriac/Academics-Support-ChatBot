# Academics-Support-ChatBot
The ignorance of today's education system in giving personal care for a student is well accepted, as they are focused only in pushing more and more into the so called "rat-race".Providing individual care for students seems unpractical, if we solely depends on their trainers.Here as part of AngelHack Kochi 2018 Hackathon,a chatbot is presented to test the capability of technology in solving this issue.As chatbots and digital assistants are developping day by day,we see a bright future for this approach in solving these kinds of problems.
